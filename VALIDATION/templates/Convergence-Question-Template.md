# Convergence Study Template

**Purpose:** Pre-register a Proof-Horizon test (FUSE/WEDGE/TEAR) for formal validation.

**Critical:** Complete ALL "Pre-Registration" sections BEFORE running test. Timestamp matters.

## Pre-Registration (COMPLETE BEFORE TESTING)

**Study ID:** CS-XXX (assigned by maintainer after PR merge)  
**Date Registered:** 2025-MM-DD HH:MM UTC  
**Researcher(s):** [Names or GitHub handles]

### Hypothesis

**What are you testing?**

### Operator Path

**Which Codex operators derive this prediction?**  
(e.g., `Zero → < (bifurcation) → δ (Feigenbaum threshold)`)

### Classical Expectation

**What does standard theory predict?**

### Codex Expectation

**What does the Fractal Codex predict differently?**

### Divergence Flag (TEAR Condition)

**What outcome would falsify BOTH theories?**

### Test Design

**Methodology:**

**Sample size/scope:**

**Success criteria:**

**Timeline:** [When will test be conducted?]

### Expected Outcome

**Prediction:** [FUSE / WEDGE / TEAR]  
**Confidence:** [1-10]

## Results (COMPLETE AFTER TESTING)

**Test Conducted:** 2025-MM-DD  
**Duration:** 

### Actual Outcome

**Category:** [FUSE / WEDGE / TEAR]

**Raw Data Summary:**

### Analysis

**Why did this outcome occur?**

**Interpretation:**
- If FUSE: How does this strengthen coherence?
- If WEDGE: What does this reveal about framework superiority?
- If TEAR: What Feigenbaum Horizon was encountered? What does it teach?

### Implications

**For framework validity:**

**For future tests:**

**For practical applications:**

### Resonance Score Impact

**Previous RS:** [from /VALIDATION/Current_Status.md]  
**Change:** [+0.5 FUSE / +2.0 WEDGE / +1.5 TEAR]  
**New RS:**
