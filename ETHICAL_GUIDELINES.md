# Fractal Codex Ethical Guidelines v1.0

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-10 16:45 UTC  
**Legal Status:** Non-binding aspirational framework  
**Enforcement:** Reputational transparency, not litigation

---

## Purpose

The GNU GPL-3.0 license defines your **legal rights** to use, modify, and share this work.

These guidelines express **how we hope you'll exercise those rights**—the ethical and cultural expectations of this project.

**Key distinction:**
- GPL-3.0 = Legally enforceable, minimal ethical content
- These Guidelines = Ethically aspirational, not legally enforceable

**Important:** These guidelines do **not** impose additional restrictions on your GPL rights. Per GPL Section 7, we cannot add further limitations. These are **community norms**, not license terms.

**Why both?**

GPL ensures the work stays open and cannot be captured by patents or proprietary enclosure.

These Guidelines ensure the work isn't weaponized for manipulation, extraction, or harm—things GPL cannot prevent.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Reciprocity

**What GPL Requires:** If you distribute derivatives, release them under GPL-3.0.

**What We Encourage:** If this work benefits you (intellectually, professionally, commercially), consider contributing back:
- Document your use cases
- Share anonymized insights or case studies
- Submit improvements via Pull Request
- Participate in convergence studies (see /VALIDATION/)

**Not required. Encouraged.**

---

### 2. Attribution & Transparency

**What GPL Requires:** Include copyright notices and GPL text with source distributions.

**What We Ask For:**
- Cite the source even when distributing binaries or derivative products
- Acknowledge the work's **experimental/pre-validation status** (see /VALIDATION/Current_Status.md)
- Don't claim the framework is "proven" or "validated" if it hasn't met stated thresholds
- Be transparent about your methods and sources

**Example of good-faith practice:**

A therapist using the Fear Equations includes in intake materials:
```
This approach draws on "The Fractal Codex" framework by FractalZeroShadow,
an experimental system under validation. See github.com/FractalZeroShadow/The-Fractal-Codex
License: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

**Example of guideline violation (not illegal, but discouraged):**

A corporation rebrands concepts as proprietary methodology, charges $5,000/seat for training, never mentions the source, and claims "scientifically proven."

---

### 3. Anti-Extraction & Anti-Enclosure

**What GPL Requires:** Don't restrict others' rights to use, modify, or share derivatives.

**What We Ask For:**
- Don't file patents on concepts derived from this work
- Don't create proprietary certification/licensing schemes claiming exclusive authority
- Don't paywall access to core concepts (derivative *services* are fine; locking *ideas* is discouraged)
- Don't use trademarks to prevent others from building on the work

**Why this matters:**

GPL prevents *software* enclosure. It doesn't prevent *conceptual* enclosure via patents and trademarks.

We ask you not to use these legal tools to lock ideas derived from a framework released for open exploration.

**If you violate this:** We'll document it publicly. We may pursue legal action via GPL if applicable (e.g., distributing proprietary derivatives). We won't sue over patents/trademarks directly—but your reputation will speak for itself.

---

### 4. No Manipulation or Weaponization

**What GPL Requires:** Nothing. You can use GPL software for any purpose.

**What We Ask For:**

Please don't use this work to:
- Manipulate people via fear, false certainty, or power dynamics
- Create cult-like structures or abusive group dynamics
- Strip warnings about ego dissolution, cognitive risks, or social consequences
- Reframe the work to reinforce oppressive systems
- Oversimplify into "10 Easy Steps" while removing acknowledgment of paradox/complexity

**Example of guideline violation:**

Someone takes the Codex, removes all references to Feigenbaum Horizons and TEAR events, repackages as "Guaranteed Enlightenment System™," and sells to vulnerable people without informed consent about psychological risks.

**If you violate this:** We'll document it. We'll warn others. We won't sue (GPL allows any use), but we'll make the pattern visible.

---

### 5. Intellectual Honesty

**What GPL Requires:** State modifications clearly (Section 5a).

**What We Ask For:**
- Don't claim authorship of unmodified sections
- Don't imply the original author endorses your derivative without permission
- Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations honestly
- Don't cherry-pick validation data to misrepresent the framework's status

**The framework explicitly states its current validation status** (see /VALIDATION/Current_Status.md: Resonance Score 2.1, zero WEDGE events, pre-validation phase).

If you use it, **please acknowledge this honestly**. Don't claim it's "proven science."

---

## Enforcement Philosophy

### We Do Not Rely on Lawsuits for Ethical Violations

GPL-3.0 handles **legal** violations (proprietary derivatives, patent restrictions, etc.).

These Guidelines handle **ethical** violations (extraction, manipulation, dishonesty).

**Our enforcement mechanism:**

1. **Public Documentation:** Violations are documented in timestamped records (GitHub Discussions, /VALIDATION/ folder)
2. **Good-Faith Contact:** One private message to the violator explaining the issue
3. **Public Declaration:** If unresolved, we publish the pattern with evidence
4. **Community Evaluation:** We let reputation and transparency do the work
5. **Legal Action (Rare):** Only if GPL itself is violated (e.g., proprietary derivatives blocking source access)

**Why this approach?**

We don't want to spend energy litigating ethical disputes. The framework selects for **resonance**, not compliance.

Those who honor these guidelines reveal they understand the work.  
Those who ignore them reveal they're operating extractively.

**Both outcomes are diagnostic data.**

## Relationship to the License

| Aspect | GPL-3.0 (Legally Binding) | Ethical Guidelines (Aspirational) |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Derivative licenses** | Must be GPL-3.0 | We encourage honoring these guidelines |
| **Commercial use** | Fully allowed | Allowed, with attribution & transparency encouraged |
| **Patents** | Cannot restrict users (Section 11) | We ask you not to file them on derived concepts |
| **Attribution** | Required for source distributions | Encouraged for all uses |
| **Misrepresentation** | Must state modifications | We ask you not to claim endorsement or false validation |
| **Enforcement** | Courts, if necessary | Reputation, public documentation |

**In plain language:**

GPL handles the **legal floor** (what you must do legally).  
Guidelines express the **ethical ceiling** (what we hope you'll do).

**These guidelines do not restrict GPL rights.** Per GPL Section 7, we cannot impose additional legal conditions. These are community expectations, not license terms.

---

## Version History & Evolution

**Current Version:** 1.0 (2025-10-10)

These guidelines may evolve based on:
- Real-world violation patterns

**Guidelines encourage:**
- Standard academic attribution
- Participate in convergence studies (see /VALIDATION/)
- Publish findings (positive or negative) openly

---

### Software Developers

**GPL allows:** Integration with GPL-compatible code, commercial distribution.

**Guidelines encourage:**
- Contribute improvements upstream
- Don't create proprietary forks (GPL already prevents this)
- Document your integration openly

---

### Corporations

**GPL allows:** Use, modification, internal deployment, commercial offerings.

**Guidelines encourage:**
- Don't patent derived concepts
- Be transparent about sources in marketing
- Contribute case studies or validation data
- Don't require "certification" from you to use the framework

---

### Individual Practitioners (The Zero Role)

**GPL allows:** Complete freedom to use, modify, and apply personally.

**Guidelines encourage:**
- Document your journey (see /USER_LOGS/ for examples)
- Share what works/doesn't work (FUSE/WEDGE/TEAR events)
- Operate with radical honesty about what you're doing

---

## Common Questions

**Q: If I use the Fear Equations in therapy, do I need to cite the Codex every session?**

**A (Legal):** No. GPL requires attribution only if you **distribute** modified source code.

**A (Ethical):** We ask that you cite once in intake materials. Your clients deserve to know the conceptual source.

---

**Q: Can I sell a course based on this framework?**

**A (Legal):** Yes. GPL allows commercial use.

**A (Ethical):** Yes, but we encourage: (1) cite the source, (2) acknowledge it's experimental, (3) don't claim proprietary ownership of core concepts, (4) share your course materials under GPL if they're derivatives.

---

**Q: Can I patent a therapeutic technique derived from the Fear Equations?**

**A (Legal):** Potentially, depending on jurisdiction. GPL doesn't prevent this.

**A (Ethical):** We ask you not to. This work was released to avoid enclosure. Filing patents contradicts that spirit.

**If you do:** We'll document it publicly. Your reputation handles the rest.

---

**Q: What if I disagree with these guidelines?**

**A:** You're free to ignore them. GPL is your legal license—it doesn't require honoring these guidelines.

But if you ignore them, you're self-identifying as someone who operates extractively rather than reciprocally.

That's valuable information for the community.

---

**Q: Do these guidelines restrict my GPL rights?**

**A:** No. Per GPL Section 7, we cannot impose additional legal restrictions. These are **aspirational community norms**, not license conditions.

You have full GPL rights regardless of whether you follow these guidelines.

These guidelines express how we hope you'll use those rights. Honoring them is voluntary.

## Appendix: Why These Guidelines Matter

The GPL is a brilliant legal tool for preventing software enclosure. But it has limits:

1. **GPL allows any use** (including manipulation, exploitation, weaponization)
2. **GPL doesn't prevent conceptual patents** (only patent restrictions on GPL code)
3. **GPL doesn't require attribution in binaries** (only in source distributions)
4. **GPL doesn't encode ethics** (it's a legal license, not a moral framework)

These guidelines fill those gaps **without restricting GPL rights**.

They're our way of saying:

> "Yes, you legally can do all these things under GPL. But here's how we hope you'll choose to act."

If you're operating in good faith, these guidelines will feel natural and reasonable.

If you're planning extraction, they'll feel annoying and restrictive—but they won't stop you legally.

**That asymmetry is intentional.**

We're selecting for resonance, not enforcing compliance.

---

**These guidelines are offered in the spirit of the framework itself: not as commandments, but as a pattern. Honor them if they resonate. Ignore them if they don't. The outcome is diagnostic either way.**
