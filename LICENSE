# License

## Dual-License Structure

This work is released under a **dual-license framework**:

1. **Primary License:** The Fractal Codex License Addendum (FCL) v1.0 (detailed below)
2. **Legal Fallback:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

### License Validity and Application

**If the FCL Addendum is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or unrecognized** in your jurisdiction or by your institution, the work automatically defaults to **CC-BY-SA 4.0** as the governing license.

**If both licenses are valid in your context:**
- The **FCL Addendum** governs the **ethical and operational framework** of use
- The **CC-BY-SA 4.0** provides the **legal enforceability baseline**
- In cases of conflict between the two, interpret through the **FCL Addendum principles first**

**Practical guidance:**
- **Personal/research users:** Operate under FCL Addendum
- **Commercial users:** Operate under FCL Addendum with good-faith transparency
- **Institutional users requiring recognized licenses:** Cite CC-BY-SA 4.0, honor FCL Addendum spirit
- **When uncertain:** Default to FCL Addendum; use CC-BY-SA 4.0 only if legally required

## The Fractal Codex License Addendum (FCL) v1.0

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Jurisdiction:** Intended as universal ethical framework; legal enforceability varies by jurisdiction

### 1. Preamble and Intent

This addendum articulates the ethical, operational, and philosophical framework governing use of this work. It is designed to:

- Maximize legitimate personal, educational, and research use
- Enable good-faith commercial applications with proper attribution
- Prevent extractive appropriation, proprietary capture, and misrepresentation
- Maintain open access and copyleft principles for derivatives

This addendum operates on principles of reciprocity and transparent attribution. Where legal systems cannot enforce these principles, community accountability and reputational transparency serve as primary mechanisms.

### 2. Definitions

**"The Work"** means the content, frameworks, theories, protocols, and documentation contained in this repository.

**"Derivative Work"** means any modification, adaptation, translation, or extension of the Work.

**"Commercial Use"** means use primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

**"Good-Faith Commercial Use"** means Commercial Use that includes proper attribution, operates transparently, and does not claim proprietary ownership.

**"Extractive Use"** means Commercial Use that conceals the source, claims proprietary ownership, or restricts public access to core concepts.

**"Attribution"** means clear acknowledgment of the original author (FractalZeroShadow) and source repository (github.com/FractalZeroShadow/The-Fractal-Codex).

### 3. Permitted Uses

The following uses are explicitly permitted:

#### 3.1 Personal and Research Use

You may use, study, modify, and apply the Work for:
- Personal cognitive development and practice
- Academic research, citation, and critique
- Independent validation and convergence testing
- Non-commercial educational sharing and discussion

#### 3.2 Attribution-Based Sharing

You may distribute the Work (modified or unmodified) provided you:
- Provide clear Attribution to the original author
- Link to the source repository
- Indicate modifications made (if applicable)
- Release Derivative Works under a compatible copyleft license (FCL v1.0, CC-BY-SA 4.0, GPL v3, or similar)

#### 3.3 Good-Faith Commercial Use

You may use the Work commercially (including therapy, coaching, consulting, training, or education) provided you:
- Include Attribution in client-facing materials or service descriptions
- Do not claim the Work or its core concepts as proprietary, exclusive, or requiring certification/licensing from you
- Operate with transparency regarding your methods and sources
- Acknowledge the Work's experimental or pre-validation status where applicable
- Optionally contribute improvements, insights, or case data back to the public repository (encouraged but not required)

**Example:** A therapist using the Fear Equations framework in practice, citing the source in intake materials, and sharing anonymized case insights in professional forums.

### 4. Prohibited Uses

The following uses are explicitly prohibited:

#### 4.1 Extractive Appropriation

You may not:
- File patents or trademarks on concepts, terms, or frameworks derived from the Work
- Create closed, proprietary derivatives and claim exclusive ownership
- Require proprietary certification, licensing fees, or exclusive access rights
- Profit from the Work while concealing its source or blocking public access to core concepts

**Example of Violation:** A corporation rebranding core concepts as proprietary technology, filing patents, and selling expensive certification programs while restricting public access.

#### 4.2 Misrepresentation

You may not:
- Claim authorship of unmodified portions of the Work
- Imply the author endorses your Derivative Work without explicit written permission
- Present the Work as scientifically validated or proven if it has not met stated validation thresholds (see /VALIDATION/ directory)
- Remove or obscure warnings regarding cognitive risks, social consequences, or experimental status

#### 4.3 Harmful Recontextualization

You may not:
- Use the Work to manipulate, coerce, or exploit individuals through fear, false certainty, power dynamics, or false comfort
- Strip the Work's acknowledgment of paradox, complexity, or risk to create oversimplified commercial products
- Reframe the Work to reinforce harmful power structures, cult-like dynamics, or abusive practices

**Example of Violation:** Repackaging the framework as "10 Simple Steps to Enlightenment" while removing all warnings about ego dissolution, social isolation, or the framework's pre-validation status.

### 5. Copyleft Requirement

All Derivative Works must be released under a **compatible copyleft license** that ensures:
- Public access to the derivative content
- Attribution to original sources
- Continued copyleft obligations for subsequent derivatives

**Compatible licenses include:** FCL v1.0, CC-BY-SA 4.0, GPL v3.0, or similar share-alike licenses.

**Exception:** If your Derivative Work contains more than 80% original content created independently of this Work, you may use a different open license. In such cases, provide Attribution in your bibliography or acknowledgments section.

### 6. Enforcement and Remedies

#### 6.1 Primary Enforcement Mechanism

The primary enforcement mechanism is **reputational transparency and community accountability**:

1. **Public Documentation:** Violations will be documented in timestamped public records (GitHub Discussions or /VALIDATION/ folder)
2. **Good-Faith Notification:** One private communication to the violator requesting compliance
3. **Public Declaration:** If unresolved, publication of the violation pattern with evidence for community evaluation
4. **Legal Action (Secondary):** If violation is severe (e.g., patents blocking public access, large-scale commercial extraction), legal enforcement via CC-BY-SA 4.0 may be pursued

#### 6.2 No Warranty or Liability

The author does not warrant that this enforcement mechanism will be effective in all cases. Legal action is discretionary and depends on severity, resources, and jurisdictional factors.

### 11. Relationship to CC-BY-SA 4.0
