This work is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later**.

## Summary of GPL-3.0 Terms

You are free to:
- **Use** the work for any purpose (personal, research, commercial)
- **Study** how the work operates and adapt it to your needs
- **Share** copies with others
- **Improve** the work and release improvements to the public

Under these conditions:
- **Copyleft:** If you distribute the work or derivatives, you must do so under GPL-3.0
- **Source Access:** You must provide source code (or written offer) to recipients
- **Patent Grant:** Contributors grant you patent rights for their contributions (Section 11)
- **No Additional Restrictions:** You cannot impose further restrictions on recipients (Section 7)
- **State Changes:** You must document modifications clearly (Section 5a)
- **Anti-Tivoization:** Hardware cannot be locked to prevent software modification (Section 6)

**Why GPL-3.0:**

This license ensures:
1. The work remains open and accessible (cannot be locked into proprietary derivatives)
2. Patents cannot be used to restrict use (explicit patent grant)
3. Hardware lockdown is prevented (installation information must be provided)
4. Global enforceability (tested in courts worldwide, OSI-approved)

**What GPL-3.0 Does NOT Require:**

- Attribution in compiled/binary forms (though encouraged)
- Non-commercial use only (commercial use is explicitly allowed)
- Specific ethical behavior beyond legal obligations

For ethical expectations beyond legal requirements, see [ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md](ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md).

## Ethical Supplement: Fractal Codex Ethical Guidelines v1.0

**Legal Status:** Non-binding. Aspirational. Culturally enforced via reputation.

The GPL-3.0 license defines your **legal rights**. These guidelines express how we hope you'll **exercise those rights**.

**Read the full guidelines:** [ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md](ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md)

**Core principles:**
- **Attribution:** Cite the source even when not legally required
- **Transparency:** Acknowledge the work's experimental/pre-validation status
- **Anti-Extraction:** Don't patent concepts derived from this work
- **No Manipulation:** Don't weaponize the framework for coercion or cult dynamics
- **Reciprocity:** Contribute improvements back (encouraged, not required)

**Important:** These guidelines do **not** impose additional legal restrictions on your GPL rights. They are community norms, not license terms.

**Enforcement:** Violations of guidelines are documented publicly for community evaluation, but do not trigger lawsuits or GPL enforcement.

**Why separate these?**

GPL-3.0 is legally enforceable but ethically minimal. The Ethical Guidelines express values GPL cannot capture. By separating them, we:
- Avoid legal ambiguity (GPL is clear, tested, recognized)
- Reduce contributor friction (everyone knows what GPL means)
- Prevent corporate compliance blockers (legal departments approve GPL immediately)

While maintaining:
- Clear ethical expectations
- Reputational accountability
- Cultural filtering (extractors self-identify when they ignore guidelines)

## For Different Use Cases

| Your Situation | What You Need to Know |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Personal use/research** | Just comply with GPL (keep it open if you share derivatives) |
| **Academic citation** | GPL allows this freely; cite per academic standards |
| **Therapy/coaching** | GPL allows commercial use; see Ethical Guidelines for attribution norms |
| **Software integration** | GPL-3.0 is compatible with other GPL/LGPL/AGPL code |
| **Corporate adoption** | Your legal team already knows GPL-3.0; point them to this file |
| **Contributing back** | Sign commits with `-s` flag (DCO), honor Ethical Guidelines |

3. **Ethical Guidelines:** Read and honor [ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md](ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md) (non-binding)

**Note:** These are project norms, not additional restrictions on GPL rights per Section 7.

## Why This Structure?

**Legal clarity:** GPL-3.0 is unambiguous, globally tested, OSI-approved.

**Ethical expression:** Guidelines capture values GPL cannot, without restricting GPL rights.

**Minimal friction:** Contributors/adopters know exactly what they're signing up for legally.

**Reputational enforcement:** Violations of guidelines are documented publicly, not litigated.

**Patent protection:** GPL-3.0 Section 11 prevents patent trolling.

**Anti-enclosure:** Strong copyleft ensures derivatives stay open.
