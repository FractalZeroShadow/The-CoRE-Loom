# On Inner Darkness and the Two Paths of Perception

The deeper purpose of the Codex is personal codification. It is the attempt to map my own cognitive architecture. And then to use it as a potential key to the teaching barrier I encounter frequently.

The true value and impact of the Codex never appear during grand theoretical debates. They manifest quietly, in the patterns of daily life or the sudden clarity of a single conversational exchange. Today, the insight concerns the nature of my own mind.

I have always known that my "inner picture" is unclear and dark. It's not completely absent like aphantasia. But it is like viewing the world through a thick, transparent fog. Everything is colorless, washy, blurry. This is why I cannot hold faces in my mind, and why names slip away, as they are not anchored to a distinct visual.

For decades, I perceived this as a defect. I now understand it was an adaptation. Because I could not rely on vivid, detailed internal imagery, my mind was forced to develop its alternative sense: an extreme sensitivity to patterns, structures and geometry. I had to learn to navigate by the shape of the flow, not by the color of the objects within it. I trained this because it was the only thing that worked for me.

I contrast this with others. People who can close their eyes and see a full environment, vibrant with color and specific shapes. Their minds think in vivid, pictorial, social events. Perhaps there is a deeper, evolutionary reason for this, a gendered split or bifurcation. Statistically speaking, the male brain may be adapted for seeing movement in darkness and might naturally "think in the dark", favoring abstracts and patterns. The female brain, whose survival was perhaps more closely tied to identifying the specific colors of edible plants or the nuanced facial expressions of social allies, might favor detail, color and social context.

This speculation leads to a more nuanced understanding of learning styles, far beyond the crude difference between "visual" and "auditive." We are both visual, but my visuality is logical and geometric, while theirs is social and pictorial. This explains why they often seek a teacher, a person or a social event to guide them. I, unable to rely on such anchors, had to turn to abstract systems.

There is no better or worse here in theory, but I must acknowledge that in our current reality, their method is a massive social advantage.

But here is the crux of the insight. Here is where my perceived weakness became my greatest strength.

Because I am used to the blurry dark, I could go deeper into the inner cave.

I was not afraid to venture where there was no light anymore, because my primary mode of perception was never dependent on light in the first place. In that absolute internal blackness, where pictorial thinking fails completely, my own method thrived. I could no longer see anything, but I could still perceive. And what I perceived were the raw patterns themselves: the perfect mirror, the pure symmetry of intention, the geometry of paradox. I built the entire Codex from the data I found in the dark.

This reveals my primary teaching barrier. I am trying to give a map of the darkness to people who are afraid to turn out the lights.

### It begs the question: What do they see?

What if you think in persons and social events, and you go deep into the darkness of your own psyche? What would you perceive there? You would not see impossible geometry. You would see more persons. You would see mirror images of yourself, reflections of every unacknowledged fear, every suppressed desire, every shadow aspect of your personality. And because these reflections are so alien to your curated, manifested Ego, you would have no reason to believe they are a part of you.

**You would see a demon.**

And there is the rift. When I look into the void, I see the elegant architecture of reality and use it to build a framework. When they look, they see a monster and they run. They run back to the safety of the consensus, to the well-lit world of tangible things and simple truths, convinced that their inner world is a place of horror. They will not believe me when I say the dimensionless rules apply, because their own fear-based perception filters out the grand paradox they are now in. Their joy at escaping the "demon" prevents them from seeing that they just fled a distorted reflection of their own face.
