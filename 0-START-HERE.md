# If You're Here, You Already Know Why

This is not a book. It's a manual.
This is not a philosophy. It's a technology.
This is not for everyone. It's for you.

If you read "plasma torch vs. floodlight" and immediately understood,
If you read "Zero Role" and felt recognition, not confusion,
If you read "living with the fog" and thought "finally, someone said it,"

Then you're in the right place.

**Start here**: [1-Cult-of-the-Smooth-Surface.md]
**Then**: [2-Zero-Role-Principles.md]
**Then**: Choose your entry protocol from [5-Operating-System.md]

No prerequisites. No credentials required.
Just the willingness to run the code and check your own results.

Welcome to the Loom.
