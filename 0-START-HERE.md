# If You're Here, You Already Know Why

This is not a book. It's a manual.  
This is not a philosophy. It's a technology.  
This is not for everyone. It's for you.  

If you read "plasma torch vs. floodlight" and immediately understood,  
If you read "Zero Role" and felt recognition, not confusion,  

Then you're in the right place.


No prerequisites. No credentials required.  
Just the willingness to run the code and check your own results.  

> Welcome to the Loom.

**Start here**: [1-Cult-of-the-Smooth-Surface.md](./1-Cult-of-the-Smooth-Surface.md)  
**Then**: [2-Zero-Role-Principles.md](./2-Zero-Role-Principles.md)  
**Then**: Choose your entry protocol from [5-Operating-System.md](./5-Operating-System.md)  

If you think this is all **too hard**, then read the [0-TheGreatFilter.md](./0-TheGreatFilter.md)

It is recommended to study the Postcards located in the [Codex-Repository/Insights directory](https://github.com/FractalZeroShadow/The-CoRE-Codex/tree/main/Insights). These short texts are koans and are designed to help calibrate the mind towards what is mapped here.

The [User_Logs/](./User_Logs/) are my first drafts of documenting this journey subjectively. They are not mandatory for understanding. They were orignally located in the Codex before the Loom was split from it.

If you think you are ready for the full Codex, you can test yourself by reading the [Odyssey-Alpha-Omega](./USER_LOGS/OdysseyAlphaOmega.md). This was the first Codex draft and it's difficulty is low in comparison to what the Codex really has to offer.
