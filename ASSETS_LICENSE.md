### Screenshots and Diagnostic Images

**Files:** `RESULT/Reaction-Claude-Opus.png` and similar screenshots

### Future Assets

If you create diagrams, illustrations, or other visual assets:
- **Default license:** CC-BY-SA 4.0 (unless explicitly noted otherwise)
- **Mark exceptions:** If a specific asset has different licensing, note it in a comment or caption

## Why Separate Licenses?

**GPL-3.0** is designed for executable works (code, documentation as source).

**CC-BY-SA 4.0** is designed for creative works (images, diagrams, non-executable media).

Using appropriate licenses for each type:
- Reduces legal ambiguity
- Matches community expectations
- Simplifies compliance for users who want to incorporate assets
